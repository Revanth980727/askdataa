## Architecture and Integration

### Service Dependencies
```
API Orchestrator
├── Connection Registry
├── Introspect Service
├── Indexer Service
├── Table Retriever Service
├── Micro Profiler Service
├── Column Pruner Service
└── Join Graph Service
```

### Data Flow
1. **Introspect Service** → Provides table and column metadata
2. **Micro Profiler Service** → Analyzes data quality and generates statistics
3. **Column Pruner Service** → Selects relevant columns based on query intent
4. **Join Graph Service** → Determines optimal table relationships and join paths
5. **Table Retriever Service** → Provides semantic search capabilities
6. **Indexer Service** → Manages vector embeddings for semantic search

### Port Allocation
- **8000**: API Orchestrator (Main workflow)
- **8001**: Connection Registry (Database connections)
- **8002**: ChromaDB (Vector store)
- **8003**: Introspect Service (Schema analysis)
- **8004**: Indexer Service (Vector indexing)
- **8005**: Table Retriever Service (Semantic search)
- **8006**: Micro Profiler Service (Data profiling)
- **8007**: Column Pruner Service (Column selection)
- **8008**: Join Graph Service (Relationship analysis)

## Technical Implementation Details

### Micro Profiler Service
- **Data Type Categorization**: Automatically categorizes columns into STRING, NUMERIC, DATETIME, BOOLEAN, JSON, BINARY, UNKNOWN
- **Quality Metrics**: Calculates null rates, distinct rates, duplicate rates, and overall quality scores
- **Statistical Analysis**: Provides min/max values, averages, standard deviations, and pattern analysis
- **Business Intelligence**: Identifies primary key candidates, foreign key relationships, and business domain insights

### Column Pruner Service
- **Relevance Scoring**: Multi-factor scoring system (query match, data quality, business relevance, performance)
- **Intelligent Filtering**: Uses configurable thresholds and exclusion criteria for column selection
- **Category Management**: Supports excluding specific column categories (e.g., metadata, system fields)
- **Recommendation Engine**: Provides actionable insights for query optimization

### Join Graph Service
- **Graph Construction**: Builds directed graph representation of table relationships
- **Path Finding**: Uses BFS algorithm to discover join paths between tables
- **Optimization Criteria**: Supports performance, simplicity, and selectivity optimization
- **Graph Analysis**: Identifies hub tables, isolated tables, and circular references

## Configuration Updates

### Docker Compose
- Added three new services with proper port mapping
- Configured dependencies and health checks
- Updated volume mounts for logs and data persistence

### Environment Variables
- Added service URLs for all Phase 2 services
- Configured host and port settings
- Maintained consistent naming conventions

## Testing and Validation

### Health Checks
All services include health check endpoints (`/health`) for monitoring and orchestration.

### API Documentation
Each service provides comprehensive API documentation via FastAPI's automatic OpenAPI generation.

### Error Handling
Robust error handling with detailed error messages and graceful degradation.

## Next Steps

### Phase 3: SQL Generation Services
The next phase will implement:
1. **Metric Resolver Service** - Business metric definition and resolution
2. **SQL Generator Service** - Natural language to SQL conversion
3. **SQL Validator Service** - SQL safety and correctness validation

### Integration Testing
- Test inter-service communication
- Validate data flow between services
- Performance testing with realistic workloads

### Production Readiness
- Add comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Implement retry mechanisms and circuit breakers
- Add authentication and authorization

## Summary

Phase 2 successfully implements the core intelligence services that form the foundation for advanced query planning and optimization. These services provide:

- **Data Intelligence**: Deep understanding of data quality, patterns, and relationships
- **Query Optimization**: Intelligent column selection and join path optimization
- **Performance Insights**: Recommendations for query performance improvement
- **Business Context**: Domain-aware analysis and recommendations

The system now has a robust foundation for intelligent query processing, with all services properly containerized, configured, and ready for integration testing.
