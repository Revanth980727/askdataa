## 🎯 Minimal Bring-Up Path

### For New Developers
Start with just the essential services to verify your setup:

```bash
# 1. Setup environment
./ops/setup.sh  # or ops\setup.bat on Windows

# 2. Start minimal stack (orchestrator + registry + ChromaDB)
docker-compose -f ops/docker-compose.minimal.yml up -d

# 3. Verify health endpoints
curl http://localhost:8000/health  # Orchestrator
curl http://localhost:8001/health  # Connection Registry

# 4. Check service status
docker-compose -f ops/docker-compose.minimal.yml ps
```

**Minimal Stack Services:**
- ✅ **API Orchestrator** (port 8000) - Main workflow coordinator
- ✅ **Connection Registry** (port 8001) - Database connection management  
- ✅ **ChromaDB** (internal) - Vector database for embeddings

### For Full System Testing
Once minimal stack is working, start all implemented services:

```bash
# Start all 9 implemented services
docker-compose -f ops/docker-compose.yml up -d

# Verify all services are healthy
./ops/test.sh  # or ops\test.bat on Windows
```

- **Adapters**: Fine-tuned LoRA models specific to the connection
- **Datasets**: Training data, feedback data, evaluation metrics
- **Traces**: Complete execution logs and debugging information
- **Metadata**: Schema information, table profiles, join graphs
- **Temporary Files**: Any cached or temporary data files

This ensures **complete data isolation** and compliance with data privacy requirements.

## 🚨 Current Limitations

### 1. Service Implementation
- **9 of 13 services** are fully implemented
- **Core workflow** can execute end-to-end SQL processing
- **Vector search** capabilities fully functional

### 2. Frontend Application

- **Integration tests** need to be created
- **End-to-end testing** not possible yet

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Development Notes

### Current System Status
- **Frontend**: React application not yet implemented (Phase 5)
- **Mock Data**: Some services return sample data for development
- **Database Drivers**: Limited to basic adapter implementations
- **Performance**: No production-level optimization or caching

### Development Limitations
